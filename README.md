This project started out being simple when it fully operated using only the console, but as soon as UI had to be added, the complexity grew a little.
I think it was a really fun project, and I am starting to feel a little more comfortable now manipulating the DOM with javascript. 
I think I will revisit this project one day to add some more interesting features maybe, but I think it looks quite appealing to me even at this stage :).
